The paper is accepted by IJCNN 2021. We provide code with nni here. We would improve this repository gradually.
## Support Data
The model with combined bases needs support data of wavelets. We only upload the support data of dataset Cora and Citeseer in supports/ considering the file sizes. The support data is got according to the source code of [GWNN](https://github.com/Eilene/GWNN).
## Normal Training
run train.py with parametes
## Fewer Training Samples
